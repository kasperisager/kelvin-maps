Kelvin Maps
===========

Kelvin Maps is a mapping application for visualising and interacting with OpenStreetMap data. It was written by [@jhtr](https://github.itu.dk/jhtr), [@mgru](https://github.itu.dk/mgru), [@npel](https://github.itu.dk/npel), [@semb](https://github.itu.dk/semb), and [@kasi](https://github.itu.dk/kasi) as our first-year project at the [IT University of Copenhagen](http://itu.dk). If all else fails, we have at least succeeded in increasing the GDP of Colombia given our aggressive coffee consumption while writing this thing :coffee:
